In this project we are going to discuss about the 74HC595 Shift Register IC. It is a Serial In Parallel Out shift register IC which is a very useful tool in the situations where we need to control a number of outputs but are not able to do so as the GPIO pins on the microcontroller are in a limited number. With the help of this IC we can control 8 different outputs just by using 3 GPIO pins of the microcontroller. Apart from that there is a pin on this IC through which we can daisychain a number of ICs to one another and if sufficient power supply is available we can control an infinite number of devices just by using three GPIO pins of the microcontroller.

Through this project we will get to know about the Working of this IC, Its Pinout, Applications and at the end we will visualize the working of this IC by controlling 8 LEDs together with the help of this IC. For detailed information about this IC, You can read its datasheet from [here](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74hc595.pdf?ts=1597564360877&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F)
